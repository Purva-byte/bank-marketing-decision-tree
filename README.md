# Bank Marketing – Decision Tree Classifier

## 📊 Project Overview
This project involves building a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.

## 📁 Dataset
- Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- Contains customer information such as age, job, marital status, balance, contact details, and previous campaign outcomes.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Steps Performed
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Encoding categorical variables
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

## 📈 Model Performance
The model predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on given features.

## 🚀 Conclusion
This project helped me understand supervised machine learning, classification models, feature importance, and model evaluation techniques.
